## Overview

The ElevenLabs [Speech to Text (STT) API](/docs/developers/guides/cookbooks/speech-to-text/quickstart) turns spoken audio into text with state of the art accuracy. Our [Scribe v2 model](/docs/overview/models) adapts to textual cues across 90+ languages and multiple voice styles. To try a live demo please visit our [Speech to Text](https://elevenlabs.io/speech-to-text) showcase page.

```

The output is classified in three category types:

- `word` - A word in the language of the audio
- `spacing` - The space between words, not applicable for languages that don't use spaces like Japanese, Mandarin, Thai, Lao, Burmese and Cantonese
- `audio_event` - Non-speech sounds like laughter or applause

## Concurrency and priority

Concurrency is the concept of how many requests can be processed at the same time.

For Speech to Text, files that are over 8 minutes long are transcribed in parallel internally in order to speed up processing. The audio is chunked into four segments to be transcribed concurrently.

You can calculate the concurrency limit with the following calculation:

$$
Concurrency = \min(4, \text{round\_up}(\frac{\text{audio\_duration\_secs}}{480}))
$$

For example, a 15 minute audio file will be transcribed with a concurrency of 2, while a 120 minute audio file will be transcribed with a concurrency of 4.

<Info>
  The above calculation is only applicable to Scribe v1 and v2. For Scribe v2 Realtime, see the
  [concurrency limit chart](/docs/overview/models#concurrency-and-priority).
</Info>

## Advanced features

<Warning>
  Keyterm prompting and entity detection come at an additional cost. See the [API pricing
  page](https://elevenlabs.io/pricing?price.section=speech_to_text&price.sections=speech_to_text,speech_to_text#pricing-table)
  for detailed pricing information.
</Warning>

### Keyterm prompting

<Info>Keyterm prompting is only available with the Scribe v2 model.</Info>

Highlight up to 100 words or phrases to bias the model towards transcribing them. This is useful for transcribing specific words or sentences that are not common in the audio, such as product names, names, or other specific terms. Keyterms are more powerful than biased keywords or customer vocabularies offered by other models, because it relies on the context to decide whether to transcribe that term or not.

To learn more about how to use keyterm prompting, see the [keyterm prompting documentation](/docs/developers/guides/cookbooks/speech-to-text/batch/keyterm-prompting).

### Entity detection

Scribe v2 can detect several categories of entities in the transcript, providing their exact timestamps. This is useful to highlight credit card numbers, names, medical conditions or SSNs.

For a full list of supported entities, see the [entity detection documentation](/docs/developers/guides/cookbooks/speech-to-text/batch/entity-detection).

## Supported languages

The Scribe v1 and v2 models support 90+ languages, including:

_Afrikaans (afr), Amharic (amh), Arabic (ara), Armenian (hye), Assamese (asm), Asturian (ast), Azerbaijani (aze), Belarusian (bel), Bengali (ben), Bosnian (bos), Bulgarian (bul), Burmese (mya), Cantonese (yue), Catalan (cat), Cebuano (ceb), Chichewa (nya), Croatian (hrv), Czech (ces), Danish (dan), Dutch (nld), English (eng), Estonian (est), Filipino (fil), Finnish (fin), French (fra), Fulah (ful), Galician (glg), Ganda (lug), Georgian (kat), German (deu), Greek (ell), Gujarati (guj), Hausa (hau), Hebrew (heb), Hindi (hin), Hungarian (hun), Icelandic (isl), Igbo (ibo), Indonesian (ind), Irish (gle), Italian (ita), Japanese (jpn), Javanese (jav), Kabuverdianu (kea), Kannada (kan), Kazakh (kaz), Khmer (khm), Korean (kor), Kurdish (kur), Kyrgyz (kir), Lao (lao), Latvian (lav), Lingala (lin), Lithuanian (lit), Luo (luo), Luxembourgish (ltz), Macedonian (mkd), Malay (msa), Malayalam (mal), Maltese (mlt), Mandarin Chinese (zho), Māori (mri), Marathi (mar), Mongolian (mon), Nepali (nep), Northern Sotho (nso), Norwegian (nor), Occitan (oci), Odia (ori), Pashto (pus), Persian (fas), Polish (pol), Portuguese (por), Punjabi (pan), Romanian (ron), Russian (rus), Serbian (srp), Shona (sna), Sindhi (snd), Slovak (slk), Slovenian (slv), Somali (som), Spanish (spa), Swahili (swa), Swedish (swe), Tamil (tam), Tajik (tgk), Telugu (tel), Thai (tha), Turkish (tur), Ukrainian (ukr), Umbundu (umb), Urdu (urd), Uzbek (uzb), Vietnamese (vie), Welsh (cym), Wolof (wol), Xhosa (xho) and Zulu (zul)._
